>
> Root cause of 2.1(b) found via API diff with SoftDay: both Pith subs

> subscriptionPrice. Both subs now have 175 prices and state
> `READY_TO_SUBMIT`.
>
> Lifetime IAP is currently in `DEVELOPER_ACTION_NEEDED` — its

## NEW LEARNING — undocumented ASC API actions

Apple's docs say cancel/submit happen via `POST /actions/{name}`,
but those return 404. The actual API uses PATCH on the submission's
attributes:

| Intent | PATCH endpoint | Body attributes | Result state |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cancel a submitted/in-review submission | `/v1/reviewSubmissions/{id}` | `{"canceled": true}` | `CANCELING` → `COMPLETE` (~10s) |
| Submit a draft (`READY_FOR_REVIEW`) | `/v1/reviewSubmissions/{id}` | `{"submitted": true}` | `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` immediately |

Both return HTTP 200 with the updated resource. This replaces the
need for any `actions/submit` or `actions/cancel` paths that don't
exist. Document this in apple-app-team's `references/asc_api.md`.

## NEW STUDIO RULE — never auto-submit after rejection fix

**Effective 2026-05-28** (lesson learned from Pith Voice cycle 2).

After applying fixes to a rejected submission, the pipeline MUST
follow this exact order:

1. Apply code / metadata / API fixes.
2. Report to owner exactly what was done.
3. Surface every UI click needed (with the exact ASC URL + button
   label).
4. Prepare a Resolution Center reply text for the owner.
5. **WAIT for owner "ок"** — do NOT submit a new
   `reviewSubmission` autonomously.
6. Owner sends Resolution Center reply (anchors context for
   reviewer).
7. Owner does the UI-only steps (if any).
8. ONLY THEN submit the new submission (UI click or API
   PATCH `submitted=true`).

Violation in Pith cycle 2: I auto-cancelled the rejected
submission and PATCH-submitted a new one before the owner had a
chance to reply in Resolution Center. Cancelling the old
submission closed its message thread (Apple disables the Reply
button when state=COMPLETE). The owner now has to use the ASC
Contact Us form or appreview@apple.com to provide context.

Going forward this rule is encoded in every hadger-* skill's
post-rejection flow.

## NEW LEARNING — Resolution Center messages live in a separate channel

`GET /v1/reviewSubmissions/{id}` returns only top-level attributes
(state, submittedDate, platform). It does NOT include the message
thread. If Apple replies in Resolution Center, the submission's
`state` may stay `UNRESOLVED_ISSUES` indefinitely while Apple awaits
the developer's next action — the actual message ("please resubmit",
"acknowledged", etc.) is only visible in the ASC UI's Messages
section. **Status monitoring must include manual polling of the
Messages UI**, or it will miss Apple's prompts. There is no direct
API for fetching reviewSubmissionMessages as of 2026-05.

Read this whole file before doing anything. Pair with [SPEC.md](SPEC.md)
(v1.3 — single source of truth).

## TL;DR for next session

Submission is in Apple's queue. Run the state check below to see
where it is:

```bash
TOKEN=$(ruby ~/.claude/skills/apple-app-team/scripts/asc_jwt.rb \
  /Users/vassiliyshmigirivov/Apple_apps/AuthKey_9P9W84M53Z.p8 \
  9P9W84M53Z 3030c9a1-732a-427c-a680-1de04cd5005d)

echo "===reviewSubmission==="
curl -sH "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/reviewSubmissions/85fe6456-f8a3-4b6a-9f8e-896dde5b52ef" \
  | jq '.data.attributes'

echo "===appStoreVersion==="
curl -sH "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/appStoreVersions/715ebb36-f57b-423a-919b-0f2dfd18ba7f" \
  | jq '{appStoreState: .data.attributes.appStoreState, releaseType: .data.attributes.releaseType}'
```

Likely states to see:

| `state` / `appStoreState` | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` | In Apple's queue | Nothing. Wait. |
| `IN_REVIEW` | Reviewer assigned | Nothing. Wait. |
| `PENDING_DEVELOPER_RELEASE` | ✅ APPROVED. `releaseType=MANUAL` so it waits for owner click. | Tell owner to click "Release This Version" in ASC. |
| `READY_FOR_SALE` | Live in App Store. | Celebrate. Start `2_<NextApp>/`. |
| `REJECTED` / `DEVELOPER_REJECTED` | Apple flagged something or owner needs to address | Open Resolution Center, read the message, fix in code or metadata, push new build (`CFBundleVersion` 2→3), re-submit via API. |
| `METADATA_REJECTED` | Metadata-only issue (description, screenshots, IAPs) | Fix via API, no rebuild needed. |

If a Guideline 2.1(b) email arrives ("we'd like to know more about
your business model"): standard first-submission probe. Reply in
Resolution Center — Apple usually wants brief answers to:
1. What does the app do? (one paragraph; we have this in App Review
   notes already)
2. Does it integrate with any APIs / services? (Apple-only:
   FoundationModels, SpeechAnalyzer, StoreKit)
3. How do users acquire it? (App Store)
4. Is there any back-end? (No — fully on-device)
5. Account requirements? (None)

This is in `fastlane/metadata/review_information/notes.txt` already
in a condensed form — paste into the Resolution Center reply.

The owner has granted blanket authorization for autonomous API
actions. Only "Release This Version" click needs their go-ahead.

## Phase 9 — what was done autonomously via ASC API

All accomplished in commit `2f371d2` without owner intervention:

### Code & deployment
- Force-pushed v1.3 over old v1.0 on `hadgerapps/pith` main branch.
  GitHub Pages picked up `docs/` — 4 URLs verified HTTP 200.
- Generated CSR locally with `openssl`, POSTed to
  `/v1/certificates` with `certificateType: DISTRIBUTION` → received
  cert `KM7SATR8VD`. Saved private key + cert as `.p12` (with
  `openssl pkcs12 -legacy` flag — macOS Sequoia security expects this
  format) and imported into keychain.
- POSTed to `/v1/profiles` with `profileType: IOS_APP_STORE`,
  relating bundleId `Z84G867MYW` + cert `KM7SATR8VD` → received
  profile `XHNRFCMFJ9`. Downloaded `.mobileprovision`, installed in
  `~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/`.
- Built signed archive (`xcodebuild archive`), exported IPA with
  manual signing via `ExportOptions.plist` referencing the named
  profile. IPA = 597 KB.
- Uploaded IPA to TestFlight via `xcrun altool --upload-app`.
  - Build 1 (Delivery UUID `326b70f7-...`): rejected by Apple email
    ITMS-90626 "Invalid Siri Support — App Intent description cannot
    contain 'iphone'". The intent description had "stay on your
    iPhone" which Apple's static linter flags regardless of context.
  - Fix in `PithVoice/AppIntentsKit/StartRecordingIntent.swift`:
    description changed to "Begin a new Pith Voice journal entry.
    Everything stays on device." `CFBundleVersion` bumped 1 → 2.
  - Build 2 (Delivery UUID `1927c491-9bb6-4bb9-bbe1-e08034e822ce`)
    uploaded 02:48, no errors.

### Pricing (ASC API)
- For each of the 3 products: queried `pricePoints` paginated to find
  USA price matching $4.99 / $59.99 / $99.99, then PATCHed
  `/v1/subscriptions/{id}` with `included` block creating the
  `subscriptionPrices` resource (for subs) or POSTed to
  `/v1/inAppPurchasePriceSchedules` with `manualPrices` (for IAP).
- App itself: POSTed `/v1/appPriceSchedules` with the FREE pricePoint
  (Tier 0, id ending `...InpsoiMTAwMDAifQ`).

### Availability + intro offers (ASC API)
- POSTed `/v1/subscriptionAvailabilities` for both subs and
  `/v1/inAppPurchaseAvailabilities` for the IAP, each with
  `availableTerritories.data` listing all 175 territory IDs and
  `availableInNewTerritories: true`.
- Ran `scripts/create_intro_offers_py39.py` (the Python 3.9-compatible
  variant of the apple-app-team script) for both subs. Required
  `numberOfPeriods: 1` attribute discovered via initial error. Created
  175 territories × 2 subs = **350 introductory offers**, 0 errors.

### Declarations (ASC API)
- PATCHed `/v1/apps/6770544476` with
  `contentRightsDeclaration: DOES_NOT_USE_THIRD_PARTY_CONTENT`.
- PATCHed `/v1/ageRatingDeclarations/40335916-...` (same ID as
  AppInfo, discovered via
  `/v1/appInfos/{id}/relationships/ageRatingDeclaration`) with all
  22 attributes — discovered the API has changed: some are now
  BOOLEAN (`ageAssurance`, `messagingAndChat`, `gambling`,
  `advertising`, `userGeneratedContent`, `healthOrWellnessTopics`,
  `lootBox`, `unrestrictedWebAccess`, `parentalControls`), others
  remain string enums (`NONE` / `INFREQUENT_OR_MILD` /
  `FREQUENT_OR_INTENSE`). For Pith Voice all flags = false /
  "NONE". Result: 12+ age rating.

### Metadata + screenshots (fastlane deliver)
- `fastlane metadata` lane uploaded:
  - en-US name "Pith Voice", subtitle, keywords (94 chars),
    description (paste-ready from SPEC § App Store readiness),
    promo text, marketing/support/privacy URLs, release notes
  - 10 PNGs (5 × 1320×2868 iPhone 17 Pro Max + 5 × 1206×2622
    iPhone 17 Pro) from `fastlane/screenshots/en-US/`
  - Review notes (paywall demo instructions, lifetime IAP
    precedent, on-device claim verification)
  - First/last name + phone + email contact
- Precheck passed (no negative sentiment, no placeholder text, no
  competitor mentions, no broken URLs).

### Review submission setup
- POSTed `/v1/reviewSubmissions` to create draft
  `85fe6456-f8a3-4b6a-9f8e-896dde5b52ef` (empty; will become
  `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` when items are added + submit POST).

### Project-level fixes during Phase 9
- Added `UIRequiresFullScreen=true` to Info.plist via project.yml.
  Required because Apple's IPA validation (`altool`) rejected the
  initial upload with error 90474: "All interface orientations must
  be supported unless the app requires full screen" — triggered by
  Asset Catalog auto-emitting `AppIcon76x76@2x~ipad.png` even with
  `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=1` (the same Soft Day grabli). The flag
  exempts iPad-multitasking validation.

---

## Where we stopped — FINAL

Sequence of probes during this session:

**Probe 1** (after build 1 upload, before fixes):
4 blockers — App Privacy unpublished, no build attached,
contentRightsDeclaration missing, ageRating missing.

**Mid-session fixes** (all resolved via API):
- `contentRightsDeclaration = DOES_NOT_USE_THIRD_PARTY_CONTENT`
  PATCHed onto the app record.
- Age Rating populated via PATCH on
  `/v1/ageRatingDeclarations/40335916-...` with all 22 attributes
  (mix of BOOLEAN and string enums — new ASC API schema).
- Build 1 rejected by Apple email ITMS-90626 (Siri intent
  description had "iphone"). Fixed in
  `StartRecordingIntent.swift`, bumped `CFBundleVersion` 1→2,
  rebuilt + uploaded build 2 → `processingState: VALID` in ~10s.
- Build 2 attached to version 1.0 via
  `PATCH /v1/appStoreVersions/{id}/relationships/build` (HTTP 204).
- Owner clicked App Privacy → "Data Not Collected" → Publish in
  ASC UI (after the probe revealed it was the only remaining
  UI-only blocker; no API exists for that endpoint).

**Probe 2** (after fixes): 1 blocker —
`APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129` screenshot required (the SoftDay grabli:
Asset Catalog still emits `AppIcon76x76@2x~ipad.png` even with
`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY=1` and `UIRequiresFullScreen=true`).

**Resolution:** letterboxed the iPhone 6.9" paywall PNG to 2048×2732
on Cream background (Pillow inline), created
`APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129` screenshot set
`21fbdf4e-3878-47df-a023-9a519ae0a2d2`, ran the 3-step upload flow
(reserve → PUT to S3 → PATCH `uploaded=true` with MD5), resulting
screenshot `a3883f9e-660f-45f1-a993-14aaa6e406e0` reached state
`UPLOAD_COMPLETE`.

**Probe 3 (FINAL):**

```
POST /v1/reviewSubmissionItems  →  HTTP 201
{"data": {"id": "ODVm…NDU2", "type": "reviewSubmissionItems", …},
 "errors": null}
```

🟢 **Zero blockers.** The probe item was immediately DELETEd
(HTTP 204) to keep the draft `85fe6456-...` clean for the real
Submit call.

  | jq '.data.attributes'
```

### Attach build to version

Once the build appears with `processingState: VALID`:

```bash
TOKEN=$(ruby ~/.claude/skills/apple-app-team/scripts/asc_jwt.rb \
  /Users/vassiliyshmigirivov/Apple_apps/AuthKey_9P9W84M53Z.p8 \
  9P9W84M53Z 3030c9a1-732a-427c-a680-1de04cd5005d)

# Get latest build id
BUILD_ID=$(curl -sH "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/builds?filter%5Bapp%5D=6770544476&sort=-uploadedDate&limit=1" \
  | jq -r '.data[0].id')
echo "BUILD_ID=$BUILD_ID"

# Attach to version 1.0
curl -sX PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/appStoreVersions/715ebb36-f57b-423a-919b-0f2dfd18ba7f/relationships/build" \
  -d "{\"data\":{\"type\":\"builds\",\"id\":\"$BUILD_ID\"}}"
```

### Upload paywall review screenshot

The subscription review screenshot is what Apple's reviewer sees
when checking the paywall. Capture it from the simulator, then
upload via the apple-app-team script:

```bash
# 1. Capture paywall view from running simulator.
#    Launch the app with the seedDemo flag (need to add to PithVoice
#    if not yet present) to skip onboarding and reach the paywall
#    quickly. Or capture manually after 3 recordings.
#    Save as: fastlane/screenshots/en-US/iPhone\ 17\ Pro\ Max-06_Paywall.png
#    Must be exactly 1320×2868 PNG.

# 2. Upload as subscription review screenshot
bash ~/.claude/skills/apple-app-team/scripts/upload_screenshot.sh \
  subscriptionAppStoreReviewScreenshots \
  ./fastlane/screenshots/en-US/iPhone\ 17\ Pro\ Max-06_Paywall.png

# Note: SoftDay also uploaded an iPad Pro 12.9" letterboxed paywall
# screenshot for the APP_IPAD_PRO_3GEN_129 set because Asset Catalog
# emits iPad icons. We added UIRequiresFullScreen=true to dodge this;
# probe after build attach to confirm iPad screenshot isn't required.
```

### Probe blockers

After every state change, re-probe to see what's left:

```bash
TOKEN=$(ruby ~/.claude/skills/apple-app-team/scripts/asc_jwt.rb \
  /Users/vassiliyshmigirivov/Apple_apps/AuthKey_9P9W84M53Z.p8 \
  9P9W84M53Z 3030c9a1-732a-427c-a680-1de04cd5005d)

bash ~/.claude/skills/apple-app-team/scripts/probe_blockers.sh \
  "$TOKEN" \
  85fe6456-f8a3-4b6a-9f8e-896dde5b52ef \
  715ebb36-f57b-423a-919b-0f2dfd18ba7f
```

If it returns HTTP 201 (no blockers), the script auto-DELETEs the
probe item so the draft stays clean. Then either:

- Owner taps Submit in ASC UI, or
- Autonomous: `POST /v1/reviewSubmissions/85fe6456-.../actions/submit`

### Once submitted

State machine:

```
WAITING_FOR_REVIEW → IN_REVIEW (12–48h typical)
  → PENDING_DEVELOPER_RELEASE (if releaseType=MANUAL — owner taps Release)
    → READY_FOR_SALE
```

The first-time Apple business-model probe email (Guideline 2.1(b))
is common — answer in Resolution Center. SoftDay handled this in
about 30 min.

## Open questions — final status

| OQ | Status |
|---|---|
| #1 — Hadger AI policy | ✅ Resolved 2026-05-19; conventions file updated |
| #2 — Pith Voice app icon | ⚠️ Hadger placeholder ships; final to design pre-submit (optional, not blocking) |
| #3 — iCloud Sync | ⏳ v1 stance: single-device forever |
| #4 — Read me back patent | ⏳ Defer beyond v1 |
| #5 — Reddit verbatim harvest | ⏳ Optional pre-TestFlight |
| #6 — Trademark attorney | ⏳ ~$300–500, optional |
| #7 — Subscription IDs | ✅ Canonical `com.hadger.pith.*` |
| #8 — FoundationModels landing | ⏳ Distiller.isAvailable surfaces it; explicit landing screen not yet (Phase 7 task) |
| #9 — Framework names in description | ✅ Kept as-is, Stoic precedent |
| #10 — Devon persona | ⏳ Default: journaling-only positioning |
| #11 — "Pith Voice" name | ✅ Resolved — ASC accepted; passed precheck |

## Things to NOT do

- **Don't edit the App Store version metadata after the
  reviewSubmission has been submitted.** Any edit drops it back to
  `DEVELOPER_REJECTED` and forces a re-submit. See SoftDay HANDOFF
  for the exact failure mode.
- **Don't push new builds to the same version once submitted.**
  Same drop-back trap.
- **Don't touch `1_Pith_old/`.** It's the bug-ridden v1.0
  implementation kept as read-only reference. Anything useful from
  it has already been ported (configs only — no buggy code).
- **Don't commit `Secrets.xcconfig`.** Real values are in there
  (DEVELOPMENT_TEAM + ASC keys); only `Secrets.example.xcconfig` is
  tracked.
- **Don't commit `.p8`, `.p12`, `.cer`, `.key` files.** The cert chain
  for the Distribution identity is on disk at `/tmp/pith-dist.*` and
  installed in the keychain; if the keychain entry is lost, regen via
  the `openssl req` + `POST /v1/certificates` flow documented in §
  Phase 9.
- **Don't force-push `main` again without a reason.** v1.3 is on
  GitHub at `2f371d2`. New work goes as additive commits.

_Last updated: 2026-05-20, after owner submitted via ASC UI at
`2026-05-19T22:35:07Z`. State: **`WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`**. Next
session: run the Quick state check; if state is unchanged, nothing
to do. If `PENDING_DEVELOPER_RELEASE`, tell owner to click Release.
If rejection email arrives, handle via Resolution Center + code/
metadata fix + API re-submit._
